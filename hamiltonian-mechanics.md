# Hamiltonian Mechanics

Hamiltonian mechanics reformulates [Lagrangian mechanics](lagrangian-mechanics.md) using position and momentum as independent variables. This framework is essential for [quantum mechanics](quantum-mechanics.md), statistical mechanics, and reveals deep geometric structure through [Lie groups](lie-groups.md) and symplectic geometry.

## From Lagrangian to Hamiltonian

### The Legendre Transformation

Starting from the Lagrangian $L(q, \dot{q}, t)$, define the **canonical momentum**:

$$
p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}
$$

The **Hamiltonian** is defined by the Legendre transformation:

$$
\boxed{H(q, p, t) = \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i - L(q, \dot{q}, t)}
$$

where $\dot{q}_i$ is expressed in terms of $p_i$ by inverting the momentum definition.

**What this means:** We're switching from $(q, \dot{q})$ coordinates to $(q, p)$ coordinates—from configuration space to **phase space**. This seemingly technical change has profound consequences.

### Example: Free Particle

Lagrangian: $L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2$

Momentum: $p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} = m\dot{x}$ → $\dot{x} = p/m$

Hamiltonian:

$$
H = p\dot{x} - L = p \cdot \frac{p}{m} - \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{p}{m}\right)^2 = \frac{p^2}{m} - \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{p^2}{2m}
$$

**What this means:** The Hamiltonian is kinetic energy expressed in terms of momentum. For conservative systems, $H = T + V$ (total energy).

## Hamilton's Equations

The equations of motion become first-order in time:

$$
\boxed{\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \qquad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}}
$$

These replace the single second-order Euler-Lagrange equation with two first-order equations.

**What this means:** Position and momentum evolve symmetrically (almost). The equations have a beautiful antisymmetric structure—$q$ changes in the direction $H$ increases with $p$, while $p$ changes *opposite* to how $H$ increases with $q$.

### Verification

From $H = p^2/2m + V(q)$:

$$
\dot{q} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \frac{p}{m} \quad \checkmark \quad (p = m\dot{q})
$$

$$
\dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = -\frac{dV}{dq} = F \quad \checkmark \quad (\text{Newton's second law})
$$

## Phase Space

**Phase space** is the space of all possible states $(q, p)$—for $n$ degrees of freedom, it's $2n$-dimensional.

### Phase Space Trajectories

A system's evolution traces a curve through phase space. Hamilton's equations define a **flow**—a vector field on phase space:

$$
\vec{v} = \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} \right)
$$

**What this means:** Every point in phase space has a unique future (and past). Trajectories never cross. This is the geometric picture of determinism.

### Liouville's Theorem

The phase space volume is conserved under Hamiltonian flow:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int dq \, dp = 0
$$

**What this means:** Hamiltonian evolution is "incompressible"—phase space regions change shape but not volume. This is fundamental to statistical mechanics: ensembles of systems preserve their phase space volume.

## Poisson Brackets

The **Poisson bracket** of two functions $f$ and $g$ on phase space:

$$
\boxed{\{f, g\} = \sum_i \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i} \frac{\partial g}{\partial p_i} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial g}{\partial q_i} \right)}
$$

### Properties

| Property | Expression |
|----------|------------|
| Antisymmetry | $\{f, g\} = -\{g, f\}$ |
| Linearity | $\{af + bg, h\} = a\{f, h\} + b\{g, h\}$ |
| Leibniz rule | $\{fg, h\} = f\{g, h\} + \{f, h\}g$ |
| Jacobi identity | $\{f, \{g, h\}\} + \{g, \{h, f\}\} + \{h, \{f, g\}\} = 0$ |

**What this means:** Poisson brackets give phase space the structure of a **Lie algebra** (see [Lie groups](lie-groups.md)). They measure how much two functions "fail to commute" under the flow.

### Fundamental Brackets

$$
\{q_i, p_j\} = \delta_{ij}, \qquad \{q_i, q_j\} = 0, \qquad \{p_i, p_j\} = 0
$$

**What this means:** These are the classical analogs of the quantum commutation relations $[\hat{q}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$. The correspondence $\{\cdot, \cdot\} \to \frac{1}{i\hbar}[\cdot, \cdot]$ connects classical and quantum mechanics.

### Equations of Motion via Poisson Brackets

Hamilton's equations can be written as:

$$
\dot{f} = \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
$$

For $q$ and $p$ specifically:

$$
\dot{q}_i = \{q_i, H\} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \qquad \dot{p}_i = \{p_i, H\} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}
$$

**What this means:** Time evolution is generated by taking Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian. This is the classical analog of Heisenberg's equation $\dot{\hat{A}} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[\hat{A}, \hat{H}]$.

## Conservation Laws

If $\{f, H\} = 0$ and $f$ has no explicit time dependence, then:

$$
\dot{f} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f \text{ is conserved}
$$

**What this means:** Quantities that Poisson-commute with the Hamiltonian are conserved. This connects to Noether's theorem from [Lagrangian mechanics](lagrangian-mechanics.md).

### Energy Conservation

$$
\{H, H\} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{H} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}
$$

If $H$ has no explicit time dependence, energy is conserved.

### Angular Momentum

For $L_z = xp_y - yp_x$:

$$
\{L_z, H\} = 0 \quad \text{if } H \text{ is rotationally symmetric}
$$

## Canonical Transformations

A **canonical transformation** $(q, p) \to (Q, P)$ preserves the form of Hamilton's equations:

$$
\dot{Q}_i = \frac{\partial K}{\partial P_i}, \qquad \dot{P}_i = -\frac{\partial K}{\partial Q_i}
$$

where $K$ is the new Hamiltonian.

**What this means:** These are the "allowed" coordinate changes in phase space—they preserve the Poisson bracket structure. Not all transformations are canonical; canonical ones preserve the geometric structure.

### Generating Functions

Canonical transformations can be generated by functions. For example, a generating function $F_2(q, P, t)$ gives:

$$
p_i = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial q_i}, \qquad Q_i = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial P_i}, \qquad K = H + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial t}
$$

**What this means:** Generating functions are a systematic way to construct canonical transformations. They're used to simplify problems by choosing clever coordinates.

## Symplectic Structure

Phase space has a natural geometric structure called **symplectic geometry**.

### The Symplectic Form

Define the **symplectic 2-form**:

$$
\omega = \sum_i dp_i \wedge dq_i
$$

(See [differential forms](differential-forms.md) for the wedge product.)

**What this means:** This 2-form encodes the phase space geometry. It's closed ($d\omega = 0$) and non-degenerate. All of Hamiltonian mechanics can be derived from this structure.

### Hamilton's Equations Geometrically

Given the Hamiltonian $H$, the equations of motion are:

$$
\omega(X_H, \cdot) = dH
$$

where $X_H$ is the Hamiltonian vector field.

**What this means:** The symplectic form converts the "direction of steepest increase of $H$" into the direction of time evolution. This geometric view makes many results obvious.

### Canonical Transformations Preserve $\omega$

A transformation is canonical if and only if:

$$
\omega' = \omega
$$

**What this means:** Canonical transformations are exactly those that preserve the symplectic structure. This is the deepest characterization of what "canonical" means.

## Connection to Quantum Mechanics

Hamiltonian mechanics provides the classical foundation for [quantum mechanics](quantum-mechanics.md):

| Classical | Quantum |
|-----------|---------|
| Observable $f(q, p)$ | Operator $\hat{f}(\hat{q}, \hat{p})$ |
| Poisson bracket $\{f, g\}$ | Commutator $\frac{1}{i\hbar}[\hat{f}, \hat{g}]$ |
| Hamilton's equations $\dot{f} = \{f, H\}$ | Heisenberg equation $\dot{\hat{f}} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[\hat{f}, \hat{H}]$ |
| Phase space point | Impossible (uncertainty principle) |
| Canonical transformation | Unitary transformation |

**What this means:** Quantization "upgrades" the Poisson bracket to a commutator. The structure of Hamiltonian mechanics—phase space, Poisson brackets, canonical transformations—carries over to quantum mechanics almost directly.

### The Fundamental Brackets Become Commutators

$$
\{q, p\} = 1 \quad \longrightarrow \quad [\hat{q}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar
$$

This is the origin of the Heisenberg [uncertainty principle](quantum-mechanics.md).

## Example: Harmonic Oscillator

### Lagrangian

$$
L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2}k x^2
$$

### Hamiltonian

$$
p = m\dot{x}, \qquad H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}kx^2
$$

### Hamilton's Equations

$$
\dot{x} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \frac{p}{m}, \qquad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = -kx
$$

### Phase Space Orbits

Combining: $\ddot{x} = -\omega^2 x$ with $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$.

The phase space trajectories are **ellipses**:

$$
\frac{p^2}{2mE} + \frac{kx^2}{2E} = 1
$$

**What this means:** Constant energy contours are ellipses in $(x, p)$ space. The system orbits these ellipses forever—visualizing oscillation as rotation in phase space.

## Summary

| Concept | Expression | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Hamiltonian | $H = \sum p_i \dot{q}_i - L$ | Total energy (usually) |
| Hamilton's equations | $\dot{q} = \partial H/\partial p$, $\dot{p} = -\partial H/\partial q$ | First-order equations of motion |
| Phase space | $(q_1, \ldots, q_n, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ | Space of all states |
| Poisson bracket | $\{f, g\} = \sum (\partial_q f \partial_p g - \partial_p f \partial_q g)$ | Measures "failure to commute" |
| Canonical transformation | Preserves $\{q, p\} = 1$ | Allowed phase space coordinate changes |
| Symplectic form | $\omega = \sum dp_i \wedge dq_i$ | Geometric structure of phase space |

**The essential insight:** Hamiltonian mechanics reveals the geometric structure underlying dynamics. Phase space has a natural symplectic geometry, Poisson brackets form a Lie algebra, and this structure carries over almost unchanged to quantum mechanics—making it the bridge between classical and quantum physics.
